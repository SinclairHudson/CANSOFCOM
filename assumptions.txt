Drone parameters
N: The number of blades in a single rotor. Almost always 2. For now, we're not considering multi-rotor drones
f_rot: (1/s) the frequency of rotation of the rotor. This is drone-dependent, but could be [50, 180]
L_1: (meters) The distance of the blade roots from the center of rotation of the rotor. For now, assumed to be 0.
L_2: (meters) The distance of the blade tips from the center of rotation of the rotor. Differs depending on drone, generally 0.05 to 0.25.

Scenario parameters:
A_r: a scale factor, arbitrary constant. Set to 1 for now.
R: (meters) The distance from the radar to the center of rotation (the rotor). Could be in the 1000 to 5000 range (a few kilometers). Assumed to be 0 for this hackathon.
theta: (radians) the positive angle between the plane of rotation of the rotor and the line of sight from the radar to the center of rotation (of the rotor). In the range [0, pi/2].
V_rad: (rad/s) the radial velocity of the center of rotation (of the rotor) with respect to the RADAR. Assumed to be 0 for this hackathon, but this would affect doppler considerations.

RADAR parameters:
f_c: (1/s) the transmitted RADAR frequency. In the range [10GHz, 94 GHz]
lambda: (meters) the wavelength of the transmitted signal. lambda = c/f_c, where c is the speed of light in m/s.


t: (s) the time, our real-valued continuous input.
f_s: (1/s) the sampling frequency (how often we sample our RADAR return signal). 1-2KHz for low frequency RADAR, 1-20KHz for higher frequency RADAR.
